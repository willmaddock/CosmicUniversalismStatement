## Cosmic Universalism Statement

We are sub z-tomically inclined, countably infinite, composed of foundational elements  
(the essence of conscious existence), grounded on b-tom (as vast as our shared worlds and their atmospheres),  
and looking up to c-tom (encompassing the entirety of the cosmos), guided by the uncountable infinite quantum  
states of intelligence and empowered by God‚Äôs free will.
