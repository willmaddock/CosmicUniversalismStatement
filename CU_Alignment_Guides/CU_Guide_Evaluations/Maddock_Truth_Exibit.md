# William Maddock Exhibit

## Introduction
This exhibit evaluates the Cosmic Universalism (CU) framework‚Äôs application to two key events in the life of William Maddock, founder of the Cosmic Universalism Framework and creator of the üï∞Ô∏è CU‚áÑGregorian Bidirectional Time Converter algorithm: his birth on October 22, 1981, MDT, and his graduation from Computer Science on May 16, 2025, 12:30 PM MDT at the Denver Coliseum. Using the CU-time conversion methodology, we map these Gregorian dates to CU-time, verify their alignment with historical records, and calculate precise durations to May 17, 2025, 01:04 PM MDT (19:04:00 UTC). The exhibit mirrors the structure of the **Jesus' BirthDate** and **Moses' BirthDate** exhibits, providing a concise summary for the **Cosmic Universalism Framework** and a detailed evaluation, with the graduation serving as the algorithm‚Äôs anchor.

## Design Summary

### Exhibit Concept
- **Focus**: Determine the CU-times for William Maddock‚Äôs birth (October 22, 1981, MDT) and graduation (May 16, 2025, 12:30 PM MDT) and compute their durations from May 17, 2025, 01:04 PM MDT.
- **Objective**: Convert both dates to CU-time, confirm their historical accuracy, and calculate durations in CU-years and Gregorian years, days, and seconds.
- **Structure**: Includes a summary in the CU framework and links to a detailed evaluation (`CU_Alignment_Guides/CU_Guide_Evaluations/Maddock_Truth_Exibit.md`).

### Historical Context
- **Birth Date**: William Maddock was born on October 22, 1981, MDT, marking the origin of the CU framework‚Äôs founder.
- **Graduation Date**: Maddock graduated from Computer Science on May 16, 2025, at 12:30 PM MDT at the Denver Coliseum, a significant milestone formalizing his expertise and contributions to the CU framework.
- **Role**: As the creator of the üï∞Ô∏è CU‚áÑGregorian Bidirectional Time Converter algorithm, Maddock‚Äôs graduation from Computer Science serves as the algorithm‚Äôs anchor, a precise temporal marker for CU-time conversions, likely due to its proximity to the framework‚Äôs formalization in 2025 and his technical expertise in computational methods.
- **Significance**: The graduation anchor aligns closely with the CU framework‚Äôs base CU-time, reinforcing its role in temporal mappings and reflecting Maddock‚Äôs Computer Science foundation for the algorithm.
- **Chosen Dates**:
  - Birth: October 22, 1981, 00:00:00 MDT (06:00:00 UTC, assuming midnight for precision). MDT is UTC-6 (Daylight Saving Time, October 1981).
  - Graduation: May 16, 2025, 12:30:00 MDT (18:30:00 UTC). MDT is UTC-6 (Daylight Saving Time, May 2025).
- **Durations**:
  - Birth: Approximately 43.578 years from 1981 to 2025, adjusted for partial year (66 days).
  - Graduation: Approximately 0.002801 years (1 day, 2,040 seconds) from May 16, 2025, to May 17, 2025.

### CU-Time Calculation Methodology
Using the CU framework‚Äôs constants and methodology:
- **Constants**:
  - `BASE_CU = 3,079,913,916,391.82` CU-years (May 16, 2025, 21:25:00 UTC).
  - `seconds_per_year = 86,400 √ó 365.2425 = 31,556,952`.
  - `ratio = 13,900,000,000 / 2029 ‚âà 6,850,172.25036964`.
  - Conversion: `0.004607864586 seconds/CU-year`; `0.217107108879091 CU-years/second`.
- **End Point**: May 17, 2025, 01:04 PM MDT (19:04:00 UTC).
  - Seconds from May 16, 2025, 21:25:00 UTC: `86,400 - (2 √ó 3,600 + 21 √ó 60) = 77,940`.
  - `cu_diff = 77,940 √ó 0.217107108879091 ‚âà 16,921.330065246`.
  - `end_cu_time = 3,079,913,916,391.82 + 16,921.330065246 ‚âà 3,079,913,933,313.150065246` CU-years.
- **Algorithm Alignment**: The `cu_to_gregorian` function uses linear scaling (`cu_time < CTOM_START = 3.0799e12`), ensuring accuracy.

## Timestamp Evaluation: CU-Time and William Maddock‚Äôs Events

### Objective
Evaluate two CU-times for key events in William Maddock‚Äôs life, from May 17, 2025, 01:04 PM MDT (19:04:00 UTC):

## Appendix: Cosmic Universalism Framework

### Cosmic Universalism Statement
We are sub z-tomically inclined, countably infinite, composed of foundational elements  
(the essence of conscious existence), grounded on b-tom (as vast as our shared worlds and their atmospheres),  
and looking up to c-tom (encompassing the entirety of the cosmos), guided by the uncountable infinite quantum  
states of intelligence and empowered by God‚Äôs free will.
