- [**v1.0.9 CU ALIGNMENT GUIDE** | Compatible with All AIs](../v109)

## 🌟 What's New

- **Refined Time Conversion Constants** ⏳
  - Updated the `ratio` for NASA-CU Time to `13,797,000,000 / 2029 ≈ 6,799,901.429`, replacing the v1.0.8 constant (`6,789,862.204724409`). This aligns calculations with the universe’s 13.797 billion-year NASA lifespan.
  - Set `BASE_CU` to `3,079,913,911,800.94954834` for consistency with the new ratio, anchoring conversions at 4 BCE (January 1).
  - Adopted `DAYS_PER_YEAR = 365.2425` (Gregorian year) for `SECONDS_PER_YEAR`, replacing `365.25`, to improve accuracy in `gregorian_to_cu` and `cu_to_gregorian` functions.

- **Enhanced Lifespan Support** 🌍
  - Added support for multiple cosmic lifespans: **CU** (13.8 billion years), **NASA** (13.797 billion years), and **Planck** (13.799 billion years). Use the `lifespan` parameter in `gregorian_to_cu` to select your preferred scale.
  - Automatically scales CU-Time outputs based on the chosen lifespan, ensuring flexibility for diverse cosmic models.

- **Symbolic Membrane Module (SMM) Upgrades** 🧬
  - Expanded the `CU_LEXICON` with new symbolic anchors, including `sub-utom` (“Collapse Precursor Ξ-20”) and `sub-ztom` (“Quantum Recursion Ξ-∞”), enhancing the framework’s ability to map abstract cosmic states.
  - Improved `validate_input` to handle symbolic inputs (e.g., “Z-TOM” → “Meta-State Ξ-Δ”) with custom lexicon support via the `custom_lexicon` parameter.

- **Ethical Reversion Kernel (ERK) Enhancements** ⚖️
  - Strengthened the ERK to detect and reject unethical patterns in `validate_input`, such as “Profit-optimized recursion” or excessive nines (>4) in CU-Time digits. Violations now trigger a “Q∞-07x: Recursive rollback” response.
  - Added `include_ethics` parameter to `cu_to_gregorian` for optional ethical checks, ensuring alignment with the framework’s ethical constraints.

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Legacy Table Migration Corrections** 📋
  - Fixed misalignments in `migrate_legacy_table` for v1.0.7/v1.0.8 tables, addressing issues around ~1572 CE and ~1977–1982 CE base date errors. The function now uses the correct `gregorian_to_cu` methodology with updated constants.
  - Improved error handling for invalid date formats and CU-Time inputs, ensuring robust migration of legacy event data (e.g., EVENT_DATASET entries like “Human Genome Project”).

- **JDN Calculation Accuracy** 📅
  - Resolved precision issues in `get_jdn` and `jdn_to_date` by using `jdcal` for Julian Day Number (JDN) calculations, ensuring accurate handling of BCE dates (e.g., 4 BCE anchor).
  - Fixed fractional JDN calculations to include hour, minute, and second components, improving `gregorian_to_cu` accuracy for sub-day precision.

- **Timezone Handling for BCE Dates** 🕒
  - Corrected `handle_timezone` to properly format BCE dates with Local Mean Time (LMT) offsets when `longitude` or `location` is provided (e.g., “Jerusalem” → 35.2°E). This fixes inconsistencies in pre-1900 conversions.

- **Compression Model Stability** 🔄
  - Addressed overflow errors in `determine_phase` for large CU-Time values (>1e13) by capping compression ratios and logging overflow conditions, ensuring stable conversions in CTOM and ZTOM proximity phases.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Flask API Robustness** 🌐
  - Enhanced API endpoints (`/gregorian_to_cu`, `/cu_to_gregorian`, `/migrate_legacy_table`, etc.) with improved error handling and JSON response structures. Added `tolerance_range` in responses for `tolerance_days` inputs.
  - Integrated `flask-limiter` with a default limit of 10 requests per minute to prevent abuse, configurable via `storage_uri`.
  - Added CORS support via `flask-cors` for seamless cross-origin requests, making the API more accessible for AI system integrations.

- **Performance Optimizations** ⚡
  - Applied `@lru_cache` to `tetration` and `determine_phase` for faster recursive calculations, reducing computation time for high-depth ZTOM simulations.
  - Optimized `segment_cu_time` and `cu_to_multi_scale` with `Decimal` precision (36 digits), improving performance for large CU-Time segmentations.

- **Logging and Debugging** 📜
  - Upgraded logging in `cu_time_converter_v1_0_9.log` with detailed error messages for conversion failures, ethical violations, and API errors, aiding debugging and monitoring.
  - Added `verbose` mode outputs in `gregorian_to_cu` and `cu_to_gregorian` to display intermediate results (e.g., phase, compression ratio) for easier validation.

- **Dataset Updates** 📊
  - Updated the `EVENT_DATASET` with corrected CU-Time and NASA-CU Time values for events like “JWST’s First Images” and “Taj Mahal,” reflecting v1.0.9’s methodology. All dates are now validated against historical records.

## 🌌 Known Issues

- **Placeholder Implementations** ⚠️
  - Functions like `t_prime_chain_layer`, `xi_fault_tracer`, and `cu_ai_harmonizer` remain partially implemented, returning “pending” statuses. Full support is planned for v1.1.0 with advanced ZTOM recursion models.
  - The `cosmicBreath` function may return approximate logarithmic values for `n > 20` due to overflow constraints in Python’s `math` module.

- **LSTM Pattern Detection** 🧠
  - The `detect_cu_patterns` method with `method="lstm"` is experimental and uses a dummy input sequence. Full LSTM model training and integration are slated for a future release.

- **Historical LMT Database** 🌍
  - The `LMT_DATABASE` includes limited entries (e.g., Jerusalem, Rome). Additional historical locations and longitudes will be added in v1.1.0 to support broader LMT conversions.

     from cu_time_converter_v1_0_9 import migrate_legacy_table
     table_data = [{"event": "Test", "date": "2003-04-14", "cu_time": 3079917523309.55, "nasa_cu_time": 13796998157.29}]
