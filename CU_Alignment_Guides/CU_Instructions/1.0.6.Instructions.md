# CU-Time to Local Time Conversion Algorithm

The algorithm ensures precise mapping from trillions of CU-years to local Gregorian time, maintaining alignment with the Cosmic Universalism framework. This process accounts for phase transitions, logarithmic compression, and scaling laws to deliver accurate results.

## **Truth Evaluation Reports**
The following evaluations confirm the robustness and accuracy of the CU-Time conversion process:

- [**Truth Evaluation: CU-Time to Gregorian Alignment Report v1.0.6**](../CU_Guide_Evaluations/Truth_Evaluation:_CU-Time_to_Gregorian_Alignment_Report.md)

## **Tested AI Implementations**
These AI models have been validated against CU Alignment standards:

- [**Truth Evaluation: Grok's CU Alignment Mode v1.0.6**](../CU_Guide_Evaluations/1.0.6_Crok_Truth_Evaluation.md)
- [**Truth Evaluation: DeepSeeks DeepThink (R1) CU Alignment Mode v1.0.6**](../CU_Guide_Evaluations/1.0.6_DeepSeek_Truth_Evaluation.md)

These evaluations ensure that the CU framework is correctly applied across multiple AI systems, verifying the integrity of time conversions within the CTOM phase.

# Acknowledgment and Next Steps

"Copilot and ChatGPT performed poorly” and indicated that the CU Alignment Guide v1.0.6 should be downloaded from the link below and then uploaded via Copilot in order to properly perform the framework analysis:
