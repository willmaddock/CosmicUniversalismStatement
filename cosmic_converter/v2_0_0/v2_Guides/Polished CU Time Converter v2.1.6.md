# 🚀 Bash Commands for `cu_time_converter_v2_1_6` (Stable v2.1.6)

This polished guide lists all possible Bash commands for the `cu_time_converter_v2_1_6` tool (stable version 2.1.6) in the Cosmic Universalism (CU) framework. Commands are formatted in triple backticks (```) for easy copying and pasting into any AI’s prompt interface (e.g., Grok, ChatGPT, Claude). Simply copy a command and paste it with “Run this command: [command]” to simulate execution or get an explanation. The commands cover 🕒 CU-Time conversions (e.g., “11/02/1569 to CU time”), 🌌 CU Lexicon queries (e.g., ztom, anti-dark energy), 🧪 testing, ⚙️ configuration, and 🖥️ system management, all tailored to the CU framework.

## 📋 Instructions
- **Copy a Command**: Click and drag to select the command within the triple backticks (```), then copy it. Most platforms auto-copy when you select text.
- **Paste into AI**: Use a prompt like “Run this command: ```[pasted command]```” (e.g., “Run this command: ```./cu_ai_prompt.sh "Calculate CU-Time for 11/02/1569 00:00:00 UTC"```”). The AI will simulate the output, explain the command, or respond based on its capabilities.
- **No Local Setup**: Commands are designed for AI prompt submission, not local execution, simulating a CU CLI environment.
- **Dependencies**: Assumes simulated Python 3, `decimal`, `pytz==2023.3`, `jdcal==1.4.1`, `convertdate==2.4.0`, `pymeeus==0.5.12`, `psutil==5.9.5`.
- **Log File**: References `/var/log/cu_ai_prompt.log` for simulated logging.
- **API Endpoint**: Uses `https://x.ai/api` for advanced queries (placeholder).
- **Time Reference**: Based on 06:02 AM UTC, May 25, 2025 (12:02 AM MDT, May 25, 2025).
- **CU-Time**: Anchored to February 29, 2000 (`BASE_CU = 3094134044923.672659`).
