## 🚀 Highlights
- 🎉 **First GUI Release**: Transitioned from the stable v2.1.6 Python command-line tool to a web-based graphical user interface (GUI).
- 🌌 **Cosmic-Themed Interface**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a visually stunning, responsive experience.
- 📈 **New Features**: Added CSV import/export, conversion history with favorites, and enhanced error handling.

## 📝 What’s New
This release marks a significant evolution from the command-line-based v2.1.6, introducing a user-friendly GUI while retaining the core CU-Time conversion logic. Key additions include:

- **Graphical User Interface**:
  - Web-based app with a cosmic-themed design, featuring a starry background and gradient styling.
  - Responsive layout for seamless use on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Conversion Tools**:
  - Convert Gregorian dates to CU-Time, CU-Time to Gregorian, calculate tom durations, and compute durations between dates.
  - Supports BCE/CE eras, AM/PM time formats, and Julian date inputs.
- **Conversion History & Favorites**:
  - Save conversion results and mark favorites for quick access.
- **CSV Import/Export**:
  - Import multiple conversions from CSV files with headers "Description,DateTime,Output".
  - Export results to CSV for external analysis.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Added an error boundary to prevent crashes and display user-friendly messages.
  - Modal dialogs for input validation (e.g., invalid dates or times).
- **Cosmic Universalism Statement**:
  - Prominently displayed in the header with clickable links to the GitHub repository.
  - Styled as a nested card with a cosmic gradient for thematic consistency.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed a critical syntax error in the `validateTime` function (unterminated regex).
- Improved handling of edge cases, such as extreme dates or invalid inputs.
- Corrected favicon loading issue for local testing.
- Updated background image URL to a stable Unsplash link.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- The GUI may experience rendering delays on older browsers due to in-browser Babel compilation.
- CSV import may not handle malformed files gracefully.
- Some responsive design elements (e.g., modal dialogs) may need refinement for smaller screens.

## 🔮 Future Plans
- 🛠️ **GUI Enhancements**: Add animations, tooltips, and interactive visualizations (e.g., cosmic timeline charts).
- 🌍 **API Integration**: Connect to external data sources for real-time astronomical events.
- 📅 **Extended Formats**: Support additional time formats (e.g., ISO 8601 variants).
- 🐞 **Stability Improvements**: Address performance issues and optimize for broader browser compatibility.
- 📚 **Documentation**: Expand user guides and add developer documentation for contributors.

## 📋 Transition from v2.1.6
The v2.1.6 Python version was a stable command-line tool focused on core CU-Time conversion logic. Version 2.2.0 ports this logic to a web-based GUI, making it more accessible but introducing potential stability challenges as the first GUI release. Users of v2.1.6 will find the same accurate calculations, now wrapped in an interactive interface.
