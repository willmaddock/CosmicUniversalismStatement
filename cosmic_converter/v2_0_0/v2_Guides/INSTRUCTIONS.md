# üåü Cosmic Universalism Time Converter v2.2.0 User Guide

Welcome to the **Cosmic Universalism Time Converter v2.2.0**, a web-based tool that transforms how you explore time across cosmic scales! Built from the stable v2.1.6 Python version, this is the first GUI release, offering an intuitive interface to convert between Gregorian dates and Cosmic Universalism Time (CU-Time), calculate durations, and dive into the CU Lexicon. While the GUI is new and may have minor stability issues, more updates are coming to enhance your experience. Let‚Äôs embark on this cosmic journey! üåå

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and navigate to the app‚Äôs URL.
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled for full functionality.

2. **Interface Overview**:
   - **Header**: Features the title and Cosmic Universalism Statement, both linking to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/willmaddock/CosmicUniversalismStatement).
   - **Navigation Tabs**: Switch between conversion tools (Gregorian to CU-Time, CU-Time to Gregorian, Tom Duration, Calculate Duration).
   - **Main Content**: Input forms and results display.
   - **Footer**: Displays licensing information (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for content, MIT for code).

## üîç Using the Conversion Tools
The app offers four main tabs for time exploration:

### 1. Gregorian to CU-Time
Convert a Gregorian date to CU-Time, including cosmic phase and geological epoch.
- **Steps**:
  1. Enter a date in `MM/DD/YYYY` format (e.g., `05/26/2025`).
  2. Optionally, add time in `HH:MM:SS` format (e.g., `03:48:00`) and select AM/PM.
  3. Choose the era (CE or BCE).
  4. Click **Convert** to view results, including CU-Time, cosmic phase, and historical events.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `05/26/2025 03:48:00 PM CE`
  - Output: CU-Time, epoch, phase, and time difference from reference date.

### 2. CU-Time to Gregorian
Convert a CU-Time value to a Gregorian date.
- **Steps**:
  1. Enter a CU-Time value (e.g., `3094134044966.672659`).
  2. Click **Convert** to see the corresponding Gregorian date and additional details.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `3094134044966.672659`
  - Output: Gregorian date, cosmic phase, and more.

### 3. Tom Duration
Calculate the duration of a "tom" unit from the CU Lexicon.
- **Steps**:
  1. Select a tom from the dropdown (e.g., `sub-ztom`).
  2. Click **Calculate** to view the duration in CU-Time and seconds.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `ztom`
  - Output: `1 sec (ZTOM: full universal reset, Empowered by God‚Äôs Free Will)`.

### 4. Calculate Duration
Compute the duration between two Gregorian dates.
- **Steps**:
  1. Enter two dates in `MM/DD/YYYY` format, with optional times and eras.
  2. Click **Calculate** to see the duration in CU-Time and years.
- **Example**:
  - Inputs: `05/26/2025 03:48:00 PM CE` and `07/20/1969 08:17:00 PM CE`
  - Output: Duration in CU-Time and approximate years.

## üìö Additional Features
- **CU Lexicon** üìñ:
  - Click **Show CU Lexicon** to view all tom units and their descriptions.
  - Example: `sub-ztom: 5.39e-44 sec (Planck time, quantum core)`.
- **Conversion History** ‚≠ê:
  - View past conversions in the ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù section.
  - Click the star (‚òÜ/‚òÖ) to mark/unmark favorites.
- **CSV Tools** üìä:
  - **Upload CSV**: Import conversions from a CSV file with headers `Description,DateTime,Output`.
  - **Download Results**: Export results to a CSV file.
  - **Save Edited CSV**: Save modified results to a new CSV file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tips for Best Use
- **Input Accuracy**: Use correct formats (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY`, `HH:MM:SS`) to avoid errors.
- **Clear Results**: Use the ‚ÄúClear Results‚Äù button to reset the results section.
- **Explore Lexicon**: Review the CU Lexicon to understand cosmic time scales.
- **Favorites**: Save frequently used conversions for quick access.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use a modern browser for optimal performance.

## üìà Example Workflow
| Step | Action | Example Input | Expected Output |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Select Tab | Gregorian to CU-Time | - |
| 2 | Enter Date | `05/26/2025` | - |
| 3 | Add Time | `03:48:00 PM` | - |
| 4 | Choose Era | `CE` | - |
| 5 | Convert | Click **Convert** | CU-Time: `3094134044966.672659`, Epoch: Present, etc. |
| 6 | Save | Click **Download Results** | CSV file with results |
| 7 | Favorite | Click star (‚òÜ) | Added to favorites |
