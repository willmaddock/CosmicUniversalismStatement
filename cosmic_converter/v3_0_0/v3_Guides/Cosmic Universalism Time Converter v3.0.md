- 📱 **Responsive Navigation**: Replaced toggle-based sidebar with a responsive design featuring a fixed sidebar on large screens and a top navigation bar on smaller screens.
- 🌌 **Enhanced Stability**: Improved GUI performance and error handling, building on the v2.2.0 foundation.
- 🎨 **Refined UI**: Polished cosmic-themed interface with better responsive design and user experience.

## 📝 What’s New
This release addresses critical calibration issues from v2.2.0 and enhances the user interface for better accessibility and usability. Key changes include:

- **BASE_CU Recalibration**:
  - Updated `BASE_CU` to `new Decimal('3094134044923.509753564772922302508810')` to correct inaccuracies in v2.2.0’s `3094134044923.672659`.
  - Adjusted related constants (e.g., `SUB_ZTOM_CU`) to align with the new calibration, ensuring precise CU-Time conversions.
- **Responsive Navigation System**:
  - **Large Screens (≥768px)**: Implemented a fixed sidebar for navigation, visible by default, with tabs for Gregorian to CU-Time, CU-Time to Gregorian, and CU-Time Calculator.
  - **Small Screens (<768px)**: Introduced a top navigation bar in the header, automatically displayed, with the same tabs, ensuring seamless access on mobile devices.
  - Removed toggle button and `showSidebar` state, simplifying the codebase and improving user experience.
- **GUI Enhancements**:
  - Optimized responsive design for better performance across devices, addressing v2.2.0’s issues with smaller screens.
  - Improved modal dialog rendering and alignment for consistent display.
  - Enhanced button styling with Tailwind CSS for better hover effects and accessibility.
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Reduced rendering delays by optimizing React component rendering and Tailwind CSS usage.
  - Improved error boundary to catch and display errors more gracefully.
- **Codebase Refinements**:
  - Streamlined navigation logic by leveraging Tailwind’s responsive classes (`hidden md:block`, `md:hidden`).
  - Removed deprecated toggle logic, reducing complexity and potential bugs.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed inaccuracies in CU-Time calculations due to the miscalibrated `BASE_CU` in v2.2.0.
- Resolved rendering issues with modal dialogs on smaller screens, improving visibility and interaction.
- Corrected CSV import handling for malformed files, adding better validation and error messages.
- Fixed minor styling inconsistencies in the cosmic-themed interface (e.g., button alignment, gradient transitions).

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- Older browsers may still experience minor rendering delays due to in-browser Babel compilation.
- CSV import may require stricter validation for edge cases (e.g., extremely large files).
- Sidebar on very narrow desktop screens (e.g., 768–900px) may need further spacing adjustments.

## 🔮 Future Plans
- 📊 **Interactive Visualizations**: Add cosmic timeline charts to visualize CU-Time conversions.
- 🌐 **API Integration**: Incorporate real-time astronomical data for enhanced context in conversions.
- 📱 **Mobile Optimization**: Further refine touch interactions and mobile-specific layouts.
- 🛠️ **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for faster load times and broader browser compatibility.
- 📖 **User Guides**: Develop comprehensive documentation and tutorials for end-users and contributors.

## 📋 Transition from v2.2.0
Version 2.2.0 introduced the first GUI for the Cosmic Universalism Time Converter, transitioning from the Python-based v2.1.6. However, the `BASE_CU` constant (`3094134044923.672659`) was not calibrated correctly, leading to potential inaccuracies. Version 3.0.0 corrects this with a recalibrated `BASE_CU` (`3094134044923.509753564772922302508810`) and introduces a more robust navigation system. The responsive sidebar and top bar replace the toggle-based sidebar, improving usability across devices. All core features from v2.2.0 (CSV import/export, conversion history, favorites) are retained and enhanced.

## 📜 Changes from v2.2.0
- **Major**:
  - Recalibrated `BASE_CU` constant for accurate CU-Time calculations.
  - Replaced toggle-based sidebar with responsive sidebar (large screens) and top navigation bar (small screens).
- **Minor**:
  - Improved modal dialog rendering and alignment.
  - Enhanced CSV import validation and error handling.
  - Optimized button styling and hover effects.
  - Streamlined codebase by removing toggle logic.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed calculation errors due to incorrect `BASE_CU`.
  - Corrected responsive design issues on smaller screens.
  - Improved CSV import for malformed files.
