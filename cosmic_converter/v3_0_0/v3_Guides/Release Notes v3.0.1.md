## üåü New Features: A Divine Leap Forward

### 1. Light/Dark Theme Toggle with Cosmic Flair
- **Celestial Ambiance**: Bask in the glow of the *Light Theme* or plunge into the abyss of the *Dark Theme*, with a cosmos-inspired background (sourced from [Unsplash](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1462331940025-496dfbfc7564)) that shifts opacity (0.2 for light, 0.5 for dark) to evoke the universe‚Äôs mystery.
- **Theme Toggle Button**: A wordless button in the navigation title, adorned with **Font Awesome** sun (`fas fa-sun`) and moon (`fas fa-moon`) icons, lets you switch themes with a single click. It‚Äôs like flipping between the Big Bang and a black hole!
- **Browser-Synced Default**: The app auto-detects your browser‚Äôs `prefers-color-scheme` for a seamless start, aligning with your cosmic vibe.
- **Dynamic UI Adaptation**: All elements‚Äîcards, buttons, inputs, and headers‚Äîuse **CSS variables** (`--background-color`, `--text-color`, `--card-background`, etc.) to ensure a cohesive, divine aesthetic across themes.

### 2. Enhanced Navigation: A Galactic Compass
- **Responsive Sidebar**: The navigation menu, now a sleek sidebar, is fixed on desktop and toggleable on mobile (via a `‚ò∞` button). It‚Äôs your cosmic GPS, guiding you through the app‚Äôs five tabs:
  - **Gregorian to CU**: Convert earthly dates to CU-Time and NASA‚Äôs cosmological scale.
  - **CU to Gregorian**: Transform CU-Time back to human-readable dates.
  - **Calculator**: Perform arithmetic on CU-Time with divine precision.
  - **Research**: Dive into the science behind the *Cosmic Breath* and NASA‚Äôs 13.787 billion-year timeline.
  - **About**: Explore the *Cosmic Universalism* story and its creator, William Maddock.
- **Active Tab Highlighting**: The current tab glows with a `cosmic-button` style, making navigation as intuitive as a supernova‚Äôs shine.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The menu collapses on smaller screens, ensuring a clutter-free cosmic journey.

### 3. Cosmic UI Enhancements
- **Cosmic Button Styling**: Buttons now feature a `cosmic-button` class with a gradient background in dark mode (`#8B5CF6` to `#3B82F6`), hover effects (scale up, shadow, brightness boost), and smooth transitions for a divine click experience.
- **Interactive Cards**: Result cards, input forms, and sections hover with a subtle lift (`translateY(-2px)`) and shadow, giving a 3D cosmic pop.
- **Fade-In Animations**: New elements fade in with a 0.5s animation, mimicking the universe‚Äôs gradual unveiling.
- **Orbitron Font**: The header uses the futuristic *Orbitron* font, paired with *Inter* for body text, blending cosmic flair with readability.

### 4. Cosmic Breath Section: Inhale the Universe
- **Togglable Cosmic Breath**: Click the header (‚ÄúCosmic Breath Time Converter - click to inhale/exhale‚Äù) to reveal a detailed section on the *3.108 trillion-year Cosmic Breath cycle*. It covers:
  - **Expansion Phase**: From *sub-ztom* (Planck time, 5.39e-44 seconds) to *sub-btom* (supercluster formation).
  - **Compression Phase**: From *btom* (galactic contraction) to *ztom* (universal reset).
  - **CU Lexicon**: Definitions for *sub-ztom*, *sub-btom*, *btom*, and *ztom*, with an expandable full lexicon (e.g., *sub-ytom*, *sub-xtom*).
  - **Math Rendered with KaTeX**: Equations like `3.108 \times 10^{12} years` are beautifully displayed for cosmic clarity.
- **Links to Deeper Insights**: Connect to [Cosmic Breath Calculation](https://github.com/willmaddock/CosmicUniversalismStatement/blob/main/ResearchFiles/Cosmic_Breath_Calculation.md) and [Cosmic Breathing Cycle](https://github.com/willmaddock/CosmicUniversalismStatement/blob/main/ResearchFiles/Cosmic_Breathing_Cycle.md) on GitHub.

### 5. CSV Upload/Download: Data in the Cosmos
- **Upload CSV**: Import time data via a styled `cosmic-button` upload input, parsed with **PapaParse** for seamless integration.
- **Download Results**: Export results as a CSV file with a single click, perfect for cosmic record-keeping.
- **Clear Results**: A trash-can-iconed (`fas fa-trash`) button wipes the slate clean, ready for new calculations.

### 6. Precision and Science
- **60-Digit Precision**: Powered by **Decimal.js**, ensuring calculations are as precise as a pulsar‚Äôs pulse.
- **NASA Alignment**: Converts to NASA‚Äôs 13.787 billion-year universe age (per [Planck 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...641A...1P/abstract)), with CU-Time at `3,094,213,000,000.014691` for June 1, 2025.
- **BCE Support**: Handle dates before the Common Era with ease, expanding the tool‚Äôs temporal reach.
