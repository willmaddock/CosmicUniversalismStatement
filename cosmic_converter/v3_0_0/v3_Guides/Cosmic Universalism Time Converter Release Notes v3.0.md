## 📝 What’s New
This major release transitions from v2.2.0, introducing new features, fixing critical bugs, and enhancing usability. Key changes include:

- **NASA Alignment**:
  - Added a “NASA Cosmic Time Converter” tab in the CU Time Converter’s navigation, linking to `https://willmaddock.github.io/CosmicUniversalismStatement/cosmic_converter/v3_0_0/nasa_time_converter_stable_v3_0_0.html`.
  - The NASA converter is accessible only through this tab, streamlining navigation.
- **Research Tabs**:
  - Introduced Research tabs in both converters, displaying detailed research on cosmic time alignment, including NASA’s universe age estimate (13.79441474 billion years as of June 1, 2025), CU framework’s extended timeline (e.g., May 12, 71,957,015 AD for 3,094,206,000,000 CU-Time), and phase mappings (sub-ztom to ztom).
- **Navigation Link Bug Fix**:
  - Corrected the CU Time Converter link in the NASA Cosmic Time Converter’s sidebar from `./cu_time_converter_stdigital_root_v3_0_0.html` to `https://willmaddock.github.io/CosmicUniversalismStatement/cosmic_converter/v3_0_0/cu_time_converter_stable_v3_0_0.html`.
  - Fixed typo in filename (`stdigital_root` to `stable`) and used an absolute URL for reliability.
- **CSV Parsing Bug Fix**:
  - Added support for `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` and `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM` formats in NASA converter’s CSV imports by appending `:00` for missing seconds.
  - Updated error message to clarify supported formats: "Use YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS] or MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM[:SS]."
- **BASE_CU Recalibration**:
  - Updated `BASE_CU` to `new Decimal('3094134044923.509753564772922302508810')` to correct inaccuracies in v2.2.0’s `3094134044923.672659`.
  - Adjusted related constants (e.g., `SUB_ZTOM_CU`) for consistency.
- **Responsive Navigation System**:
  - **Large Screens (≥768px)**: Fixed sidebar with tabs for Gregorian to CU-Time, CU-Time to Gregorian, CU-Time Calculator, NASA Cosmic Time Converter, and Research.
  - **Small Screens (<768px)**: Top navigation bar with the same tabs, ensuring mobile accessibility.
  - Removed toggle button and `showSidebar` state, simplifying the codebase.
- **GUI Enhancements**:
  - Optimized responsive design for better performance across devices.
  - Improved modal dialog rendering and alignment.
  - Enhanced button styling with Tailwind CSS for better hover effects and accessibility.
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Reduced rendering delays by optimizing React component rendering and Tailwind CSS usage.
  - Improved error boundary for graceful error handling.
- **Codebase Refinements**:
  - Streamlined navigation logic using Tailwind’s responsive classes (`hidden md:block`, `md:hidden`).
  - Removed deprecated toggle logic, reducing complexity.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed broken navigation link to CU Time Converter in NASA Cosmic Time Converter’s sidebar.
- Fixed CSV parsing bug for `HH:MM` time formats in NASA Cosmic Time Converter.
- Fixed inaccuracies in CU-Time calculations due to miscalibrated `BASE_CU` in v2.2.0.
- Resolved rendering issues with modal dialogs on smaller screens.
- Corrected CSV import handling for malformed files with improved validation and error messages.
- Fixed minor styling inconsistencies in the cosmic-themed interface (e.g., button alignment, gradient transitions).

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- Older browsers may experience minor rendering delays due to in-browser Babel compilation.
- CSV import may require stricter validation for edge cases (e.g., extremely large files).
- Sidebar spacing on very narrow desktop screens (768–900px) may need adjustment.
- Research tab content is comprehensive but may benefit from interactive visualizations.

## 🔮 Future Plans
- 📊 **Interactive Visualizations**: Add cosmic timeline charts to visualize CU-Time conversions in the Research tab.
- 🌐 **API Integration**: Incorporate real-time astronomical data for enhanced context.
- 📱 **Mobile Optimization**: Further refine touch interactions and mobile layouts.
- 🛠️ **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for faster load times and broader browser compatibility.
- 📖 **User Guides**: Develop comprehensive documentation and tutorials.
- 📚 **Research Tab Expansion**: Enhance Research tabs with interactive tools and additional data sources.

## 📋 Transition from v2.2.0
Version 2.2.0 introduced the first GUI for the Cosmic Universalism Time Converter, transitioning from the Python-based v2.1.6. However, the `BASE_CU` constant (`3094134044923.672659`) was inaccurate, and navigation was less intuitive. Version 3.0.0 corrects these issues with a recalibrated `BASE_CU`, responsive navigation, NASA alignment, Research tabs, and bug fixes. All core features (CSV import/export, conversion history, favorites) are retained and enhanced.

## 📜 Changes from v2.2.0
- **Major**:
  - Recalibrated `BASE_CU` constant for accurate CU-Time calculations.
  - Replaced toggle-based sidebar with responsive sidebar (large screens) and top navigation bar (small screens).
  - Integrated NASA Cosmic Time Converter as a tab in CU Time Converter.
  - Added Research tabs with cosmic time alignment research.
- **Minor**:
  - Fixed navigation link and CSV parsing issues in NASA Cosmic Time Converter.
  - Improved modal dialog rendering and alignment.
  - Enhanced CSV import validation and error handling.
  - Optimized button styling and hover effects.
  - Streamlined codebase by removing toggle logic.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed calculation errors due to incorrect `BASE_CU`.
  - Corrected responsive design issues on smaller screens.
  - Improved CSV import for malformed files.
