## 📝 Notes
- **Corrected CU-Time Values**: The original CU-Time values were incorrect, overestimated by ~10^5 to 10^6 (e.g., “Baby Shark” was `3094134559838.672659`, corrected to `3094134044939.972454`). This was likely due to a misapplied base constant or year offset in the `cu_time_converter_v2_1_6` module calculations. Corrected values use `BASE_CU = 3094134044923.672659` plus the delta years from Feb 29, 2000, computed as `(JDN - 2451604.5) / 365.2425`.
- **Calculation Method**: Each CU-Time was recalculated using the module’s `gregorian_to_cu` function, assuming 00:00:00 UTC for release dates. JDN was computed with `gcal2jd`, delta years derived from `(JDN - ANCHOR_JDN) / DAYS_PER_YEAR`, and CU-Time quantized to 24 decimal places.
- **Clickable Links** 🔗: Video titles are hyperlinks (e.g., [Baby Shark Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w)) that open in a new tab. Copy URLs from the “Copyable URL” column for manual use.
- **Baby Shark Included** 🦈: Tops the list with ~16B views, counted as a music video for its Billboard #32 peak and viral dance craze, ensuring no iconic hit is missed.
- **CU-Time Magic** ⏰: Release dates are converted to CU-Time using v2.1.6’s precision logic. Verify with ```./cu_ai_prompt.sh "Calculate CU-Time for [date]"``` (e.g., “Baby Shark” on Jun 17, 2016 = `3094134044939.972454`).
- **Copying Tips** 📎: Select titles, URLs, or CU-Time commands within ``` and copy with Ctrl+C. Paste into YouTube or AI prompts for viewing or analysis.
