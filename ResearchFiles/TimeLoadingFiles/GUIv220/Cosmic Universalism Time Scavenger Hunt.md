# 🌌 Cosmic Universalism Time Scavenger Hunt 🚀

> **Welcome, Time Traveler!** Embark on a thrilling journey through history and the cosmos with the Cosmic Universalism Time Scavenger Hunt! This adventure challenges you to verify **25 True or False statements** using the [Cosmic Universalism Time Converter v2.2.0](https://willmaddock.github.io/CosmicUniversalismStatement/cosmic_converter/v2_0_0/cu_time_converter_stable_v2_2_0.html). From the Moon Landing to movie premieres and famous birthdays, each statement tests your ability to match dates with their cosmic CU-Time values. Ready to explore the timeline of the universe? Let’s dive in! 🌠

---

## 🕰️ How to Play

This scavenger hunt is all about verifying whether statements about dates and CU-Times are **True (✅)** or **False (❌)**. Follow these steps to join the cosmic quest:

1. **Access the Converter**: Open the [Cosmic Universalism Time Converter v2.2.0](https://willmaddock.github.io/CosmicUniversalismStatement/cosmic_converter/v2_0_0/cu_time_converter_stable_v2_2_0.html) in your browser.
2. **Verify Statements**:
   - For statements comparing CU-Times (e.g., “Is 1969’s CU-Time less than 1989’s?”), use the **“Gregorian to CU-Time”** tab to input both dates and compare their CU-Time values.
   - For statements matching a CU-Time to a date (e.g., “Does this CU-Time match July 20, 1969?”), use the **“CU-Time to Gregorian”** tab to check the corresponding date.
3. **Check Dates and Sources**: All dates are in **UTC**, and years are within the converter’s limit (up to 99,999,999 BCE/CE). Use the provided [Wikipedia links](#references) to confirm event dates if needed.
4. **Record Your Findings**: Note whether each statement is True or False based on the converter’s output.
5. **Compare Answers**: After verifying all statements, check the [**Table of Statements and Verification**](#table-of-statements-and-verification) to see how you did.

> **Tip**: The converter is precise, so enter dates exactly as shown (e.g., “July 20, 1969”). For simplicity, you can ignore time of day unless specified, as CU-Time differences are minimal within a day.

**Ready? Let’s travel through time!** Good luck, and enjoy uncovering the cosmic connections! 🌍
